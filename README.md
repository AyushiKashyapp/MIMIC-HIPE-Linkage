## 🚦 Project Overview

This project aims to transform raw ICU data and linked external health outcomes into a **clean, anonymized, and richly featured database**, ready for machine learning and advanced research analytics. Key focuses include:

- 🔍 **Robust data cleaning and provenance logging**  
- 🔐 **Irreversible anonymization to protect patient privacy**  
- 🔗 **Realistic linkage to external datasets mimicking HIPE data**  
- 📊 **Feature engineering for clinical and temporal insights**  
- 🛡️ **Simulated governance and role-based access control**  

The goal is to enable researchers to perform predictive modeling, policy simulations, and knowledge discovery on sensitive health data while ensuring privacy and ethical compliance.

## 🔄 Workflow Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding & Exploration

- **Goal:** Gain familiarity with dataset structure, variable types, and completeness.  
- **Process:**  
  - Load core tables such as `patients`, `admissions`, `icustays`, `diagnoses_icd`, and others. 📂  
  - Examine features such as demographics, timestamps, vital signs, interventions, and outcomes. ⏰📈  
  - Identify missing values, irregularities, and distribution patterns to inform cleaning. 🧹

---

### 2️⃣ Data Anonymization Module

- **Goal:** Ensure irreversible anonymization to protect patient identity and comply with privacy regulations. 🔒  
- **Process:**  
  - Hash sensitive identifiers (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`) using secure hashing. 🔑  
  - Remove or transform direct identifiers such as exact dates of birth or admission. 🚫🗓️  
  - Apply date shifting or synthetic data substitution (e.g., with Faker) for demographics. 🧙‍♂️  
  - Simulate HIPAA-style de-identification protocols. 🏥

---

### 3️⃣ Data Linkage Simulation (HIPE & Other Sources)

- **Goal:** Simulate linking ICU data with external hospital discharge datasets (HIPE) to enrich outcomes. 🔗  
- **Process:**  
  - Create a synthetic HIPE-like dataset with patient-level outcomes such as readmission and long-term mortality. 🏥📋  
  - Perform probabilistic or deterministic linkage using anonymized identifiers. 🧩  
  - Generate linkage reports detailing match rates and data integrity checks. 📊✅

---

### 4️⃣ Research Database Design & Storage

- **Goal:** Store cleaned and linked data in a relational database optimized for research queries and scalability. 💾  
- **Process:**  
  - Design an Entity-Relationship (ER) schema capturing patients, admissions, ICU stays, interventions, diagnoses, and linked outcomes. 🗃️  
  - Implement the schema in MySQL or another RDBMS. 🛠️  
  - Populate tables using ETL scripts that perform extraction, cleaning, and loading seamlessly. 🔄  
  - Include role-based access controls within the database for governance simulation. 👥🔐

---

### 5️⃣ Data Quality and Cleaning Pipeline

- **Goal:** Prepare high-quality data with minimal noise, errors, or missingness for analysis. 🧼  
- **Process:**  
  - Handle missing data via imputation (e.g., median imputation for age). 💉  
  - Flag or remove invalid timestamp sequences (e.g., admission after discharge). 🚩  
  - Identify and address outliers or anomalous records. ⚠️  
  - Maintain comprehensive provenance logs recording every transformation and cleaning step for auditability. 📝

---

### 6️⃣ Multimodal Machine Learning-Readiness

- **Goal:** Generate patient-level feature summaries and time-aware matrices suitable for machine learning and reinforcement learning tasks. 🤖📊  
- **Process:**  
  - Aggregate vitals, labs, and interventions into statistics like mean, max, and trend slopes. 📈  
  - Encode intervention sequences and ICU stay timelines for RL or NLP models. 🧠  
  - Prepare feature matrices integrating structured tabular data with unstructured notes where available. 📑  
  - Enable downstream use cases including risk prediction, treatment policy modeling, and automated summarization. 🎯

---

### 7️⃣ Governance & Access Simulation

- **Goal:** Simulate real-world data governance processes ensuring ethical, logged, and role-restricted access to sensitive data. 🛡️  
- **Process:**  
  - Define user roles (e.g., researcher, data steward, admin) in the database. 👩‍💻👨‍💼  
  - Implement role-based data visibility restricting sensitive fields per role. 🚫👀  
  - Maintain detailed audited access logs capturing who accessed what data and when. 📜🕒  
  - Provide a README covering ethical considerations, GDPR compliance, and data usage policies. 📚⚖️
